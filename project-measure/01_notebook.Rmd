Possible investigations of the data that I find intriguing:

Climbing comparison:
As a sport climber, I'm often told about the advantages a positive ape index (wingspan-height) lends to climbing ability. If the data exists, it would be interesting to know how the measurement data for athletes on the would-be first-ever climbing Olympics teams compares to our sample set. Is this positive ape index strongly represented among the top climbers, or is this a myth?

Size relationship to dominance:
I'm also curious about qualitative covariates. My right leg is dominant and my right foot is also slightly larger - does dominance have a relationship with relative size?   

```{r, chunk-rgl-example}


#library(devtools);
#local.path = "/Users/lindseykornowske/.git/STAT419/";

library(reshape2)

quant <- read.csv("../datasets/measure/measure_quantitative.csv", sep = ",", header = T)
quant <- quant[, c(1:5)]

qual <- read.csv("../datasets/measure/measure_qualitative.csv", sep = ",", header = T)
qual <- qual[c(1:10),]

quant$mkey <- paste(quant$mkey, "-", quant$side)
quant <- quant[,-3]
quant <- cast(data = quant, data_collector+person_id~mkey)

quant <- quant[with(quant, order(person_id, decreasing = T)), ]
qual <- qual[with(qual, order(person_id, decreasing = T)), ]

measure <- data.frame(quant, qual[,-c(1,2)])

write.table(measure, "measure.txt", sep = "|")
```
